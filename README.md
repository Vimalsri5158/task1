**1.Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2**

  **HTTP/1.1**
    It works on the textual format.
    There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesn’t get its all resources.
    It compresses data by itself.
    It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages
  
  **HTTP/2**
    It works on the binary protocol.
    It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
    It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages 
    It uses HPACK for data compression.


**2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript**

  **Object**
    General Concept:
      In programming, an object is a fundamental data structure used to represent real-world entities, data, or concepts. Objects typically consist of data (properties) and behavior (methods or functions) that operate on that data.
    Usage: 
      Objects are used to model and organize data, encapsulate related functionality, and provide a structured way to work with data in a program. Objects are instances of classes, constructor functions, or other object creation mechanisms in a programming language.
    Example: 
      In JavaScript, an object can represent a person with properties like name and age and methods like sayHello. In Java, objects can be created from classes like Person with attributes and methods.
      
  **Internal representation**
    General Concept: 
      Internal representation refers to how data or objects are stored in memory or managed by a programming language, runtime environment, or data structure. It deals with the low-level details of how data is organized and accessed internally.
    Usage: 
      Understanding the internal representation of data or objects is important for optimizing performance, memory usage, and data access in a program. This concept is often relevant when working with data structures, memory management, and low-level programming tasks.
    Example: 
      In an array, the internal representation involves how elements are stored in contiguous memory locations. In an object-oriented language, the internal representation of an object includes details like how properties are stored in memory and how methods are linked to the object.
